# Default_Prediction
A machine-learning project to mitigate disparities in fairness using LightGBM and Fairlearn

• Processed UCI Credit-card Default Dataset with NumPy and Pandas and plotted Kernel density Estimation plot diagrams to show the correlation between different features and prediction results.

• Trained and tested a machine learning model with LightGBM, achieving an accuracy of 0.856.

• Created a metrics table to see the fairness and performance of the LGB machine learning model.

• Mitigated the disparities in the predictions using the threshold optimizer and grid search algorithms.

• Generated scatter plots to compare the performance(AUC or Balanced Accuracy) and fairness (Equalized Odds Difference) of the algorithms to choose the best model.
